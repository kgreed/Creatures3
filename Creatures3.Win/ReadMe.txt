Project Description

This project implements a WinForms application. The root project folder 
contains the WinApplication.cs(vb) file with the class that inherits WinApplication.
This class allows you to view and customize Module components:
referenced modules, Controllers and business classes. Additionally, the root folder
contains Application Model difference files (XAFML files) that keep application
settings specific for the current Module. Difference files can be customized in code
or in the Model Editor for .NET Core and .NET Standard (CTP).
